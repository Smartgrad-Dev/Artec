Before you start learning about Python and programming robots, let's talk for a bit about why people say programming is such a valuable skill in the first place.

First we'll think about how and where programming is used in the world around us, then about what kinds of jobs you need to be able to program in order to do.

There are many different programming languages used to write programs, including Python. We'll briefly discuss some of these languages and their uses.

Finally, we'll talk about the advantages of learning Python.

We won't start programming until the next lesson, but we hope reading this lesson will give you a clear goal to bear in mind as you go on through the course!

You may be one of the millions of people who use their smartphones and PCs everyday to chat on messaging apps, check social networking sites, or watch online videos, but do you know how all those things work?

They're all helpful services you can access by using a web browser or specialized application to communicate with a collection of computers called a **server**, which is running a complex computer program.

These days there's a lot of talk, even on the news, about what new services advanced information technology like **artificial intelligence (AI)** or **blockchains** might make possible and how those services might affect society.

Some researchers predict that, in the not-too-distant future, the development of AI technology will lead to a large number of the jobs people do now being taken over by robots and computers. On the other hand, this may also lead to the creation of new kinds of work based on this new technology, and jobs that require the kind of creativity and communication skills only humans are capable of may become more valuable.

All the technology our modern society is founded on is built using programming, yet current estimates say the workforce is still hundreds of thousands of people short on workers with sufficient understanding of computers and programming to support this technology.

Now, before we start studying programming for real, let's think a little more about what programming is capable of and how learning programming benefits you!

## Jobs That Require Programming

There are a lot of jobs these days you can't do unless you know how to program computers. Here are just a few examples...

|Jobs|What They Need Programming For|
|:---|:---|
|Smartphone App Development|Making ideas for services and games into actual working applications.|
|Operating Robots and IoT<sup>*</sup>Devices|Using sensors to retrieve information from distant locations and remotely controlling parts like motors to operate machines.|
|Data Processing Automation|Automatically compiling survey data, automatically sending emails at specified times.|
|Digital Art Creation|Manipulating lighting and sound to create uniquely digital artwork.|
	
###### ★ IoT - Short for "Internet of Things," an IoT system is a group of devices connected to each other over the internet so they can exchange information and commands with each other.

## The Many Languages of Programming

There are a huge number of different programming languages out there, but we'll take a look at a few widely used ones and talk about what makes each of them stand out.

* **Python**
This programming language was created in the Netherlands in 1991. Python is a popular language for beginners due to its simple, easy-to-read source code (that's the actual characters used to write a program). Python is also very good at handling mathematical calculations, so it's often used to develop artificial intelligence programs for use in high-demand fields like data analysis and machine learning.

* **Java**
Developed in America in the early 1990s, Java has been popular around the world for many years, which means there are a lot of systems made with it out there. Java can be used across an incredibly wide variety of projects, from web systems and smartphone apps to corporate support and mechanical control systems, and you can use it to make programs for both Windows and Mac computers.

* **C**
Originally developed in America in 1972, the versatility and extensibility of C have made it widely used today, including in the development of operating systems and the applications that run on them. C is quite old as programming languages go, so its syntax can be difficult to learn, but it has still been a common choice for a first programming language since the 1990s. The programming environment this course uses to run Python programs was actually programmed in C!

* **JavaScript**
JavaScript was developed in America in the mid-1990s, and is primarily used in web browsers. Using JavaScript in a web page allows the page to run animations, change screens in response to user input (like clicks or taps on the page), and other dynamic elements.

* **Ruby**
The Ruby programming language was originally created in Japan in 1992. The versatility and flexibility of this language makes it popular for building online systems, regardless of scale. Ruby is also popular because, compared to other languages, it can accomplish a lot in a single short line of code.

* **Swift**
Swift was developed in 2014 as a new programming language specifically for Apple products. Its development was influenced by the strong points of other languages, making it another language that's easy for beginners to use.

## Why Learn Python?
One common tool people use to start learning programming is a visual programming language called Scratch. Scratch lets you make programs easily just by dragging blocks around the screen and putting them together. This sort of programming is easy and approachable for beginners, but you can't use it to write the kind of complex programs you need to make computer systems or games. Learning to use a text-based programming language like Python requires you to learn some more difficult programming syntax, but in exchange you'll be able to accomplish much more with it!

Python is one of the most widely-used programming languages in software development, whether it's for phone applications, robotics, or artificial intelligence. This means there are a huge number of Python users out there, and they've formed an active community around the language. It's easy to find high-quality freely available source code for Python, which you can use to make your own projects go faster. You might even have heard of GitHub, a particularly well-known website where software engineers at the frontlines of development publish free source code for others to use.

###### Source code - The writing that makes up a program written in a programming language, the text of the program, or a text file with the program in it.

Information technology will only keep developing from now on, and it's likely to bring more changes to society with it, so studying programming now is likely to open even more possibilities for you in the future, as new developments create new kinds of jobs working with AI, robots, virtual currencies, and more. Commentators around the world, whether online, on paper, or on TV, look to developments in programming to see how they might change the future. We hope that you'll stick around to study Python robotics with us and have fun while learning skills that are sure to come in handy in the future!
